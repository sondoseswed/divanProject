    	Patience has departed from the parting lover,
        Who divulged the secret, confiding it to you;
        He is embarassed because of not having been able
        To take more steps along with you when taking his leave:
        Oh, brother of the full moon in high rank and splendour
        May God protect the rime which caused thee to rise!
        If your absence made my nights seem long,
        I spent this night with you complaining of its shortness!</pre></div>

 <button onclick="longi()" id="lo"> Longing </button>
    <div id="long"><pre>
    	When shall I describe my feelings
        To you, my delight, my torture?
        When will my tongue have the pleasure
        Of explaining it, instead of a letter?
        Oh you tempter in consolation,
        Oh you proof of a forlorn lover!
        Tou are the sun that has hidden
        Itself behind a veil from my eye:
