    	What throttled at my saddle? Was I riding
    a camel's body or a blast of wind?
      No sooner I'd set out from the early east
    than I had westered out past twilight's end,
      Alone as dunes, delivering me to dunes,               
    moved me from rainless waste to rainless waste.
      And I saw through the darkness like a veil
    falling across the faces of the Fates.
      My home was nowhere other than the saddle,
    my refuge was none other than the sword,
      I had no friend but the face of desire
    laughing with wishes for lips, without a word.</pre></div>
